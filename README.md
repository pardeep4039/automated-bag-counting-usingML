The efficient loading and transportation of goods, particularly in logistics and supply chain operations, are crucial for ensuring timely deliveries and minimizing costs.Traditional methods of manualy counting bags loaded onto trucks are time consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. In this project, we propose a novel
approach to automate the process of counting bags loaded on trucks using machine learning techniques.
Our proposed solution leverages computer vision algorithms to analyze images or video footage captured during the loading process. By employing object detection & recognition methods, coupled with deep learning models, we aim to accurately identify an count the bags as they are being loaded onto trucks. The system wil be 
trained on a dataset comprising annotated images of bags to enable it to recognize and differentiate between various types and sizes of bags commonly used in transportation. 
The key objectives of this project include the development of a robust machine learning model capable of accurately counting bags in real-time, the integration of 
the model into a user-friendly software interface, and the validation of the system's performance through extensive testing and evaluation. Additionaly, considerat-ions
wil be given to factors such as lighting conditions, camera angles, and environmental variables to ensure the system's reliability and adaptability across different loading scenarios.
The successful implementation of this automated bag counting system has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and productivity of loading operations, reduce manual labor requirements, minimize errors, and improve overal logistics management in various industries. Moreover, the scalability and versatility of the
proposed solution make it applicable to a wide range of transportation and warehousing environments, thereby offering considerable benefits to businesses operating 
in the logistics sector
